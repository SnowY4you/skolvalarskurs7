#### My Dashboard Project: A Journey from Concept to Final Result
<p>To ease this burden and offer a clear, data-driven approach to "school choice grade 7", I started a project to create an interactive dashboard. </p>

<p>Here are the main steps I took to realize this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Identification of the Need:** The realization of the stress and confusion surrounding school choice led me to create a tool that consolidates relevant information and presents it in a user-friendly way.
  <li>**Data collection:** The first step was to collect comprehensive data on various schools, including academic performance measures, extracurricular offerings, teacher density and geographic coordinates. I got this information from *[Skolverkets](https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/statistik "Click on 'Sök statistik'")*.
   <li>**Data cleaning:** It was important to ensure that the data was accurate and complete. I converted non-numeric values ​​to numeric and handled missing data to maintain dataset integrity.
  <li>**Calculation of Average:** I calculated average values ​​for key parameters such as percentage of students eligible for different programs and merit value.
  <li>**Defining Filters:** To make the dashboard interactive, I defined profile keywords and filters that allow users to customize their search based on specific criteria.
  <li>**Building the Dashboard Layout:** Using Dash, a Python framework, I designed the dashboard layout. This included the creation of filter blocks, a data table and a visual map component.
  <li>**Integration of Visual Elements:** I used Tabulate for table representations and Folium for map visualization. These tools helped create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard.
  <li>**Add Interactivity:** To ensure the dashboard was dynamic, I implemented callbacks that update the data table and map based on user-selected filters.
  <li>**Style and Customization:** Finally, I focused on the aesthetics, improving the user experience with custom styles, responsive elements, and easy-to-read layouts.
  <li>**Testing and Feedback:** The project concluded with rigorous testing and gathering feedback from potential users to refine and improve the dashboard.
</ul>

Termination
The purpose of the "school selection grade 7" dashboard is to demystify the school selection process and give both students and parents the tools needed to make informed decisions. It reduces stress by presenting comprehensive data in a clear and accessible manner, ultimately guiding families toward the best educational path.
